== README

This Portfolio app provides links to other websites I've developed or contributed to as well as links to sites that provide personal background (e.g., LinkedIn, Github, Google Scholar).

Glitches:
index page:
  borders around github and linkedin icons
  image row needs to be centered

about, resume & papers views:
  why doesn't background image cover the entire page?

application.css.erb
 why can't I get #bluefont working?
